        This was built to prepare myself to the Microsoft certification exam 70-480 Programming in HTML5 with JavaScript and CSS3. I tried to use as much as possible of all exam objectives. So in a page I used one way of doing things and in another I may use a different approach just to test me if I can do it. As I like beer, I created a store dedicated to the software developer pleasure. Every hard worker should relax and release the presure once in a while to increase your productivity. There is a legend that beer is the best alcoholic beverage for software developers because having a beer quiets the brain exactly to helps to shoot pieces of code and experience the state of immersion mixed with quiet enjoyment.
