# 70-480-Exam-Study-application
This was built to prepare myself to the Microsoft certification exam 70-480 Programming in HTML5 with JavaScript and CSS3.
I tried to use as much as possible of all exam objectives. 
So in a page I used one way of doing things and in another I may use a different approach just to test me if I can do it.
As I like beer, I created a store dedicated to the software developer pleasure.
